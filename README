To configure and install the CUPS email printer is relitively simple.  This printer
backend depends on the Nail program, available at http://nail.sourceforge.net/

To get the software to work, you must first copy the file email.ppd to the Model
directory of CUPS, which (on Slackware) is in "/usr/share/cups/model/".  That is the
postscript printer definition, which CUPS uses to describe it's printer configuration.
Next, edit the script itself (email) and change the variables.  Something like this
should work quite well:

    # The full and complete path to the nail program
    NAILPRG=/usr/bin/nail

    # The full path to the postscript to pdf program (ps2pdf)
    PS2PDF=/usr/share/texmf/bin/epstopdf

    # The text to send in the body of the e-mail.  The actual "printed" document is sent as a PDF attachment.
    MAILTEXT="Here is the information you requested.  If you have any questions reguarding this e-mail,
    please reply to this e-mail and we will be more than happy to explain it."

    # The from address to use.
    DEFFROM="wolfmagic13d@users.sourceforge.net"

    # The default method to get the send-to address (-j is from the jobname, -u is from the username).
    TO="-j"

After the source is configured for your environment, copy the email script to the CUPS
backend directory (/usr/lib/cups/backend on Slackware).  Add your printer via the
normal means you add a printer, and you're good to go.  That should get you set up and
running.
