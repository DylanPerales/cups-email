* cups-email

This is a fork of the old [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/cupsemailptr/][cupsemailptr]], which is a variant of [[http://vigna.di.unimi.it/fax4CUPS/][fax4CUPS]]. Improvements include:

- configuration files separated from the script, allowing easy queue-specific configurations
- using a SMTP server instead of local sendmail
- free-form parameters (like to address) through the graphical print dialogue


** Installation

This printer drivers consists of two files, the post script printer definition (email.ppd) and the backend script (email). The PPD needs to be installed to the cups model directory (usually =/usr/share/cups/model=), the script to the cups backend directory (usually =/usr/lib/cups/backend=).

The script assumes to find the cups configuration directory at =/etc/cups=. If it's different on your system you need to edit the =CUPS_BASE= variable at the beginning of the script.

All other variables can be overridden globally by adding a =$CUPS_BASE/email= configuration file, or for specific printers using =$CUPS_BASE/email-<queue>=

The script assumes to find =mailx= and =epstopdf= in =/usr/bin=. If they are installed in different location configure them in =$CUPS_BASE/email=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
MAILCMD=/path/to/mailx
PS2PDF=/path/to/epstopdf
#+END_SRC

** Configuration
*** Adding a printer

After successful installation a new printer called =E-Mail Device= should be available when adding new printers:

#+CAPTION: Selecting printer
[[./img/backend_select.png]]

The connection URI for the printer should be =email:/<queue>=:

#+CAPTION: Configure printer URI
[[./img/connection_select.png]]

Select =email= as printer driver for this new printer:

#+CAPTION: Configure printer driver
[[./img/driver_select.png]]

Finish the configuration by creating a queue configuration file in =$CUPS_BASE/email-<queue>:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
FROM=printer@example.com
#+END_SRC

*** Configuration variables

All variables can be used in both global and queue specific files. If they're specified in both locations the queue specific value overrides the global one.

**** MAILCMD
The full path to a  [[http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html][modern mailx variant]]
**** PS2PDF
The full path to =epstopdf=, nowadays commonly shipped with =texlive=
**** MAILTEXT
The text contained in the body of the e-mail
**** FROM
The from address to use for sending mails
**** TO
The location for getting the send-to address. Valid values are =-j= for using the job name and =-u= for using the user name.

Unless sending through a local sendmail the user name is most likely useless without a mail domain. If a =DEFAULTDOMAIN= variable is set =<user>@$DEFAULTDOMAIN= will be used as address.

Explicitely setting the to address via options - either as =-o ToAddress=<user@example.com>= or via the print dialogue - will override this setting.
**** MAILRC
The location of the mailrc file, defaulting to =/dev/null=

**** MAILX_VARS
A list of variables understood by mailx (see the mailx man page), which will be exported (and therefore made available to mailx). The default list is ="from ORGANIZATION replyto sender sendwait signature smtp MAILRC"=.

Any of those variables may be used in the configuration file. Most useful is the =smtp= variable, allowing sending via a SMTP server instead of local sendmail.
